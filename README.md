# decoder ring
### The decoder ring includes three different types of ciphers and works for decoding and encoding.

## Caesar shift
### Takes in a given message, a shift that is not greater than 25 or less than -25, and returns the shifted message. It can also take the a given message and decode it to the original message if given the shift used.

## Polybius square
### Takes in a given message that applies it to a polybius square to return 2 digits that represent each letter.  It also is able to decipher a numbered message that uses the polybius square so long as there is an even value of numbers provided.

## Substitution cipher
### Takes in a given message and a given alphabet and is able to apply that alphabet to each letter in the message.  It works only with a 26 character alphabet where all the characters are unique.
